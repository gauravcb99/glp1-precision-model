# GLP-1 Precision Maintenance Simulation (2025)

## Executive Summary
This project challenges the traditional "High-Dose Standard of Care" for GLP-1 agonists. Using a Monte Carlo simulation (N=2,000) anchored in 2025 HealthVerity & Prime Therapeutics benchmarks, we model the economic impact of shifting to a "Precision Maintenance" protocol (Low Dose + Digital Support).

## The Business Hypothesis
* **Problem:** High-dose therapies suffer from a "Titration Cliff" (early churn due to side effects), causing "Bad Spend" (paying list price before rebates kick in).
* **Solution:** Digital phenotypes can sustain efficacy on lower doses, improving retention and Unit Economics.

## Methodology
* **Data Source:** Synthetic cohort generated via parametric simulation.
* **Anchors:** * Retention: 63% @ 12mo (Prime Therapeutics).
    * Efficacy: 15% WL (STEP Trials) vs 7.7% Real World.
* **Key Metric:** Cost Per 1% BMI Reduction (CPBR).
